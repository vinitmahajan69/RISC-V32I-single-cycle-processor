# RISC-V32I-single-cycle-processor
A 32-bit single-cycle RISC-V processor core written in Verilog HDL. This project implements the RV32I base integer instruction set and demonstrates the design of a simple, educational CPU with instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back in a single clock cycle.
